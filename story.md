
congrats you are one of the first people to try to get to mars and there is some good and bad news 
good news you are one of the first people to make it this far for many centuries after the first moon landing to this moment in 2030
bad news your not exactly on mars but you are on one of mars moons there was a slight miss calculation and you were forced to land but you have fixed 
your ship up and although you cant go all the way to mars you should be able to make it home but yet again some bad news there is a meteor shower coming 
and the only way to save your prcious ship is to try to manuver you ship out of the meteor shower and keep going home

                                                             GOOD LUCK
